// Direct boot into Coursebot play (RECOMP_BOOT_COURSE): from the title screen, a course played the way Coursebot's
// Play plays one, without walking the menus. The same steps as smm2-hooks' direct boot in an emulator (its
// src/directboot.cpp, docs/direct-boot.md), so a run here and a recording made there start a course alike.
//
//   RECOMP_BOOT_COURSE=<file>   the course: a .bcd's 0x10-byte header and its decrypted body (0x5bfd0 bytes, "SCDL" at
//                               +0xc), as smm2-hooks' tools/directboot_cfg.py boot_bin_from_bcd writes it
//   RECOMP_BOOT_SLOT=<n>        the Coursebot slot the request names (default 0); play reads no course data from it
//   RECOMP_BOOT_KIND=<n>        the scene change's reason (default 4, cMyCourseToNormalPlay; 3 cRoboToEdit: the
//                               Course Maker)
//   RECOMP_BOOT_SETTLE=<n>      frames of title before the first request (default 150)
//   RECOMP_BOOT_KEEP=1          keep running once the course has ended (by default the run ends there)
//
// Once the title is up (the scene mode 6) and has settled, the course goes into the save buffer's slot copy (+0x6c000,
// the copy Coursebot's own Play prepares and the course loader reads: games/smm2/mods/edit.c), and the four calls of
// My Courses' play start (main+0x16e5c10) run: the request's start, the play stats, the course source and the
// commit, which asks for the scene. A request the game does not take is made again every 90 frames, eight times at
// most. While the boot is on its way (boot_holds) the pad script's clock, the trace and the probes wait: the title
// screen plays a course of its own with a player in it, and the run starts at the first player update in the course
// (the scene mode 7). A boot that does not get there ends the program (exit 3), so a scripted run never records the
// title.
//
// When the course ends, so does the run (exit 0, the probe log flushed and a call graph written), as a recording made in
// an emulator ends with the course: no player update for 120 frames once the course has run (a clear: the walk into
// the castle is the last; the scene mode stays 7 through the results), or the scene mode leaving 7. A pad script's
// clock counts player updates, so after a clear it never reaches its end (RECOMP_PAD_EXIT); on the title the clear
// goes back to the title course and its player, here it stays on the results, where about 1300 frames on the game's
// sound worker reads through a null pointer (+0x58 in main+0x2beb60, from main+0x178d5b0): the way back to a
// Coursebot scene this boot never set up. RECOMP_BOOT_KEEP=1 goes on anyway. Addresses are SMM2 v3.0.3, offsets in
// main.
